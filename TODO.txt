=============
Visualization
=============

Observe the different kinds of images.
(TRY) Plot the correlation between each pixel and the label

=============
Preprocessing
=============

Split into train, validation, and test set.
(TRY) Scale numbers (divide by 255 or use standard scaler)
(TRY) Gray Scaling
(TRY) Dimension reduction.
Scale size (probably don't need to because it is 20*20)

===========
Pretraining
===========

(TRY) Autoencoders
(TRY) Transfer learning

======
Models
======

Data Augmentation
Train different models on dataset.
Constrain the weights.
Dropout (20-50%), early stopping
Tune the model with different hyperparameters:
    *learning rate (large with decay)
    layer size
    layer number
    kernel
    stride
    activation functions

(TRY) Build multiple models with similar hyperparameters.
(TRY) Build voting classifier on top of them

View result on tensorboard.
Visualize model with keras.

Find what features (pixels) are most important
 
=======
Testing
=======

Pick a performance measure
Test performance on the models.

Tips
====

First layers are most important and we should focus on later layers.
Document observations
List all hyperparameters
